# AirBnB Clone Project
This is the first part of building our first web application: the AirBnB clone. This project was built with OOP in Python and using the "cmd" module, to create the console that will be the command interpreter.

## Description
In this first step, the objects will be created, updated, destroyed and read through the console (command interpreter) with the help of a JSON file (the objects will be stored).

## HOW TO START IT
You have to give permissions to file ```console.py``` and then execute with ```./console.py```

## HOW TO USE IT

| Command | Description |
| ```EOF```, ```quit``` or ```Ctrl + c``` | Allows you to exit the program |
| ```create <class>``` |  Creates a new instance of ```class```, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the ```id``` |
| ```show <class> <id>``` | Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id |
